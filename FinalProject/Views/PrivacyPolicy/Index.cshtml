                                data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies).
                                For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We
                                also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order

                                and to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various

                                to enhance, privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain
                                data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed
                                in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name & email.
